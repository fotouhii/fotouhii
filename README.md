Once upon a time, I wrangled pixels as an intern. Now, I'm a DevSecOps warrior at Hypesware, conquering clouds and automating like a boss (thanks, ISG & Crossroads for the training!). Here you'll find code, scripts, and maybe even a pun or two (but never in production, promise!).

What you'll find here:

Infrastructure as code for the win!
Continuous integration/deployment pipelines smoother than butter.
Automation scripts that make life easier (and way cooler).
Maybe even a glimpse into my existential crisis about semicolons.
Feel free to fork, contribute, and let's chat DevSecOps!
